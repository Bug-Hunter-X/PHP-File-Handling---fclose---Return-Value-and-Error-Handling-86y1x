```php
$file = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
if ($file) {
    // Process the file
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error
    echo "Error opening file.";
}
```
This code has a potential problem: it doesn't check the return value of `fclose()`. While `fclose()` usually succeeds, it can fail (e.g., due to I/O errors).  Ignoring the return value means you won't know if the file was closed properly, which could lead to resource leaks or data corruption.

Another potential issue in the error handling:  It only echoes an error message, without giving specific details about *why* the file couldn't be opened (permission issues, file not found etc.). More robust error handling is needed.
