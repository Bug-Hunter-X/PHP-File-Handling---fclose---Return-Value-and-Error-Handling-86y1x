# PHP File Handling Bug: fclose() and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP file handling and shows how to improve it.

The bug involves ignoring the return value of `fclose()` and inadequate error handling when opening a file.

## Bug
The `bug.php` file contains the flawed code. It opens a file, processes it (if successful), and then closes it. However, it doesn't check whether `fclose()` was successful, and the error handling is minimal.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version. It checks the return values of both `fopen()` and `fclose()`, providing more informative error messages and handling potential failures gracefully.
